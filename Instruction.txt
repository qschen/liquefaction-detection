This repository contains code and sample data accompanying the paper by Zhan and Chen (2021), "An Accelerogram-based Method for Quick Assessment of Liquefaction Occurrence", Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering. Please cite and credit this publication.


Directory
1. "Input" folder
This is where you put the input accelerogram data file for the model to process. Two sample accellerogram data files are included. 

The required format of the data file:
1) The data file is in *.csv format
2) There are four columns (from left to right): time vector, NS, EW, 
and UD component accelerograms (no headings). 
3) The units of the time vector and accelerogram are second and g (gravitational acceleration), respectively.

2. "Output" folder
This is where all output files (tables and figures for liquefaction classification and signal processing) are stored after the program is executed.

3. "main_function.m" is the main function to run the program, perform the calculations, and output results. 

4. "LowFrequencyPortion.m" and "FrequencyDropRatio.m" are functions called by "main_function.m" to perform necessary intermediate calculation steps.
